/*
Time Complexity
best: BigO(1) ---> best case
worst: BigO(N)   ---> worst case where N: size of an array

best case while iterating if the target element found at oth index then it will be best case
worst case if target element is not found while iterating then it will be a worst case
Linear search : time and size increasing with proportion as y= mx  y= size, x being time
best case no increse in time with increase in size as y = k
