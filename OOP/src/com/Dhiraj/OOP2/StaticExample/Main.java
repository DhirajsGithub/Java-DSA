/*
When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created,
and without reference to any object. You can declare both methods and variables to be static.
The most common example of a static member is main( ).
main( ) is declared as static because it must be called before any objects exist.
Static method/ static variables  in Java is a method which belongs to the class and not to the object.

A static method can access only static data. It cannot access non-static data (instance variables)
A non-static member belongs to an instance. It's meaningless without somehow resolving which instance of a class you
are talking about. In a static context, you don't have an instance, that's why you can't access a non-static member
without explicitly mentioning an object reference.
In fact, you can access a non-static member in a static context by specifying the object reference explicitly :

A static method can call only other static methods and cannot call a non-static method from it.
A static method can be accessed directly by the class name and doesnâ€™t need any object
A static method cannot refer to "this" or "super" keywords in anyway

Note: main method is static, since it must be accessible for an application to run, before any instantiation takes place.
