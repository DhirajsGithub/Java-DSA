/*
 * 
 * An array is a data structure that holds a fixed-size sequential collection of
 * elements of the same type.
 * Memory Address=Base Address+(3Ã—Size of int)
 * Keep in mind that Java abstracts away direct memory access, and the actual
 * memory management is handled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
 * The formula above is a conceptual representation, and the JVM takes care of
 * the low-level details.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * in c++ array are store continuosly in the memory like cell after cell with
 * specific address to each element.
 * cells means one by one allocation. Due to pointers
 * in java it depends on JVM
 * 1) array object are store in heap memory
 * 2) Heap object are not continuous
 * 3) Dynamic memory allocation
 * 4) hence array object in java are not continuous
