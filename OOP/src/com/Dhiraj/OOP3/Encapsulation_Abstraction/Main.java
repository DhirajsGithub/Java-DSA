/*

abstraction --> breaking things in parts
encapsulation --> hide implementation detail

abstraction --> design level
encapsulation --> implementation level

abstraction --> process of gaining information
encapsulation --> process of containing information

Differnce between encapsulation and data hiding
data hiding --> focuses on data security 
encapsulation -->  hiding the complexities of the code

abstract data types in java --> arraylist, array, String, etc (which we don't need to worry how they work they provide us with the desire method to use with them)

to achieve abstraction we need encapsulation
